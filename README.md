DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR BREAST CANCER PREDICTION

MOTIVATION:

Purpose: Explain why predicting breast cancer is crucial and how deep learning can improve diagnostic processes.

Impact: Discuss the potential impact of accurate predictions on patient outcomes and healthcare practices.

OVERVIEW:

This repository contains code and resources for predicting breast cancer using deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on imaging data. The goal is to leverage CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models to analyze medical images and improve diagnostic accuracy.

INTRODUCTION:

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers affecting women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to utilize deep learning algorithms to enhance prediction capabilities based on imaging data such as mammograms.

DATASET:

Source: Kaggle

Description: This project uses the Breast Cancer Histopathology Images dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of labeled histopathology images of breast cancer tissues.

Format: The dataset includes images in JPEG format, along with labels indicating the presence or absence of cancer.

TECHNIQUES UESD:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Utilized for extracting spatial features from imaging data. CNNs are effective in recognizing patterns and structures within images.

Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): Applied for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. GRUs can enhance the modelâ€™s ability to understand the context of features over time, particularly useful if the dataset involves time-sequenced imaging.

MODEL ARCHITECTURE:

CNN Architecture: Describe the architecture of the CNN used, including layers, activation functions, and any specific configurations.

GRU Architecture: Detail how the GRU is integrated into the model and what role it plays in feature extraction or sequence prediction.
